## Summary

In this scenario, my task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files. I will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. This is to display my ability of data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

#### Data Modeling

* Inspected the CSVs and sketched out an ERD of the tables.

#### Data Engineering

* Used the information I had to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files.
* Imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

#### Data Analysis - Code

1. Listed the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.

2. Listed employees who were hired in 1986.

3. Listed the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.

4. Listed the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. Listed all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

6. Listed all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

7. Listed all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
