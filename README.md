## Background

It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. My first major task was a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

I will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data.

#### Data Modeling

Inspected the CSVs and sketched out an ERD of the tables.

#### Data Engineering

* Used the information I had to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files.
* Imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

#### Data Analysis - Code

1. Listed the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.

2. Listed employees who were hired in 1986.

3. Listed the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.

4. Listed the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. Listed all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
